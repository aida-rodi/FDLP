# MÃ©todo de array .filter()

*Info*

- The filter() method is an iterative method. It calls a provided callbackFn function once for each element in an array, and constructs a new array of all the values for which callbackFn returns a truthy value. Array elements which do not pass the callbackFn test are not included in the new array.

- The filter() method creates a shallow copy of a portion of a given array, filtered down to just the elements from the given array that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

- If no elements pass the test, an empty array will be returned.
